    'PiastCode2__description': 'I’ve taken part in the second edition of “PiastCode” hackathon in Opole in 2017. This time my team’s goal was to create a web app which was connecting people in a very interesting way. This site had the only one-page layout, register, and login forms. In the middle of the page, we used Google Maps and its API. On the left-hand side, the user could pick a category that he is interested in. Then he puts a pin on a map. Pin drew a circle showing all the people in his area which chose the same category. They were visible on the right side of the website. He could chat with them. My work was focused on Google Maps API, drawing circles, people pins’, and their coordinates.',
    'PiastCode__description': 'I took part in a hackathon “PiastCode” held back in 2016 in Opole. My team created an application in WPF technology which task was to connect most famous historical places in our hometown with the local public transport. The user was choosing places which he was interested in. The program was responsible for finding bus stops near the locations and creating the fastest path to visit all of them. I was mostly responsible for creating an algorithm for finding nearest bus stops. When the user chose relic, I got the coordinates. Based on them I created a circle and using the formula I checked every stop if the point (X, Y coordinates) is on the circle. I enlarged the circle until I found three bus stops. I also compared the values of the buses journies times and send the fastest one to the UI.',
